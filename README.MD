Here's a README file in English for the Real-Time Bug Tracking and Issue Resolution Board project:
Real-Time Bug Tracking and Issue Resolution Board
Overview

The Real-Time Bug Tracking and Issue Resolution Board is a web application designed to help development teams manage and resolve bugs collaboratively. The application features a real-time interactive board where users can create, update, and track bug tickets across different stages of resolution. This tool is particularly useful for teams that need to stay synchronized and manage tasks efficiently in a dynamic environment.
Features

    Real-Time Updates: Changes to tickets are instantly reflected across all users' boards.
    Interactive Kanban Board: Drag-and-drop functionality for managing tickets across stages (To Do, In Progress, Done).
    WebSocket Integration: Enables real-time communication between the frontend and backend for instant ticket updates.
    RESTful API: Allows easy access to create, retrieve, and update tickets via HTTP requests.

Technology Stack

    Backend:
        Python
        Flask (Flask-SocketIO for real-time features, Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM)
        SQLite (Database)
    Frontend:
        React.js
        Socket.IO (for WebSocket connections)
        HTML/CSS
